### The `Game List` Message Structure

The `Game List` field is a [Hazel message](../01_packet_structure/03_the_structure_of_a_hazel_message.md) that contains a variable number of child Hazel messages (one for each game that matches the search criteria).

This is the structure of each child [Hazel message](../01_packet_structure/03_the_structure_of_a_hazel_message.md) in the `Game List` field.

> **Note**: The tag for each child [Hazel message](../01_packet_structure/03_the_structure_of_a_hazel_message.md) is meaningless and so any value will work.
