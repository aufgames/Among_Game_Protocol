# `0x0a` AlterGame

### Host-to-Game

This message is sent from the host of a game to all clients when the host changes a [game tag](../01_packet_structure/06_enums.md#altergametag).

| Type | Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `int32` | Game ID | The ID ([code](../07_miscellaneous/02_converting_game_ids_to_and_from_game_codes.md)) of the game |
| `byte` | Tag ID | The ID of the game tag that was altered |
| `byte` | Tag Value | The new value of the game tag |

As there is currently only one game tag, whose value is of type `boolean`, the tag value may be coerced into a `boolean`. Do note that this may change in the future.
