# `0x19` ClearVote

This *empty* message is sent by the [`MeetingHud`](../05_innernetobject_types/01_meetinghud.md) object when a player that is still alive disconnects from the game during the voting phase. This allows players that already voted for the disconnecting player to vote again.

> **Note**: This message is sent from the host of a game to all affected players via [`0x06` GameDataTo](../02_root_message_types/05_gamedata.md).
