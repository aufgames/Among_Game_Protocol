# `0x1a` AddVote

This message is sent by the [`VoteBanSystem`](../05_innernetobject_types/08_votebansystem.md) component when a player votes to kick another player.

> **Note**: This message is sent to and from all clients in a game via [`0x05` GameData](../02_root_message_types/05_gamedata.md). It is **never** sent from the host of a game as the host will immediately kick the player without the need to vote.

| `uint32` | Voting Client ID | The client ID of the player who cast the vote |
| `uint32` | Target Client ID | The client ID of the player that was voted to be kicked |
