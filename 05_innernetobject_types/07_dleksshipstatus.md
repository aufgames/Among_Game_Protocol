# `DleksShipStatus`

The `DleksShipStatus` object is spawned at the start of a game on *The Skeld* (*on April 1st*) and despawned at the end of the game. It holds the flipped map for *The Skeld* and is responsible for controlling the interactive systems throughout the map.

Aside from the map being flipped on the Y axis, it is identical to [`SkeldShipStatus`](00_skeldshipstatus.md).
