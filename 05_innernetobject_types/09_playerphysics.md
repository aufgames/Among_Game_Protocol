# `PlayerPhysics`

The `PlayerPhysics` object is spawned for each player that joins a game lobby and despawned at the end of the game. It is responsible for a player's character entering and exiting vents. It has two sibling objects: the [`PlayerControl`](04_playercontrol.md) and [`CustomNetworkTransform`](10_customnetworktransform.md) objects.

No data is contained in this object and so nothing needs to be serialized or deserialized.
